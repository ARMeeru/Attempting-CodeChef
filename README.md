# Attempting-CodeChef
Decided to code after five long years. Been exposed to scripting for last two years but I feel like missing something. That something is communication. Communication between the knowledges and experiences I have.
# Language
[golang](https://go.dev/) as few colleagues convinced me ðŸ˜† and I am really feeling comfortable around this.
# Project Structure
Mindless as I am now. No sub-folder even. Practice problems will be updated from time to time but contests problem will be updated after it ends. Files are named after Problem Code of CodeChef.
# Attempted Contests
- [April Long One 2022, Division 4 (Rated)](https://www.codechef.com/APRIL221D) : Ranked 7872 with a score of 300. Got TLE on [Dazzling GCD Pair](https://github.com/ARMeeru/Attempting-CodeChef/blob/main/NOTUNIT.go). Probable reason could be my input taking/reading method.
